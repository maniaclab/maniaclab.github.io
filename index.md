    description: We build advanced cyberinfrastructure supporting the largest scientific instruments probing the most fundumental questions of nature.
    description_2: We take our name from an earliest computer built on campus, the Maniac III (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Computer Model III).  MANIAC III was a second-generation electronic computer (i.e., using solid state electronics rather than vacuum tubes), built in 1961 for use at the Institute for Computer Research at the University of Chicago.
