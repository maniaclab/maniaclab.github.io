    description: We build advanced cyberinfrastructure supporting the largest scientific instruments probing the most fundumental questions of nature.
    description_2: We take our name from one of the earliest computers ever built at the University by Nicholas Metropolis (BSc 1937 and PhD 1941), modeled from his earlier MANIAC computers at Los Alamos. The Maniac III (Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Computer Model III) was a second-generation computer (replacing vacuum tubes with solid state components), built in 1961 in the Institute for Computer Research at the University of Chicago.
