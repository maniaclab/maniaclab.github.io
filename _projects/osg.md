## What We Do
The OSG provides common service and support for resource providers and scientific
institutions using a distributed fabric of high throughput computational
services. The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to
users and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and
sharing of resources. The OSG is jointly funded by the Department of Energy and
the National Science Foundation. here for a two-page printable overview of OSG.

The Open Science Grid (OSG) supports science such as:
- High Energy Physics
- Structural Biology
- Community VO (multiple sciences): OSG Connect
