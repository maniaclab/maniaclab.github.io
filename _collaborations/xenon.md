MANIAC Lab operates the Rucio global data management service for the XENON Dark Matter Search Experiment in Gran Sasso, Italy.

We also provide a large and fast analytics cluster for the ATLAS Distributed Computing operations team using the "ELK stack" (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and a machine learning platform with access to approximately 30 GPU cards in the Lab.
