We lead the ATLAS Midwest Tier2 Center, as of February 2026 providing 50 000 CPU-cores, 26 PB of storage, integrated into the worldwide LHC computing grid, accessible by every member of the international ATLAS collaboration. 

We also provide a large and fast analytics cluster for the ATLAS Distributed Computing operations team using the "ELK stack" (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and a machine learning platform with access to approximately 30 GPU cards in the Lab.

Finally the ATLAS Analysis Facility at UChicago offers physicists a mix of traditional batch computing alongside of forward-looking technologies like Kubernetes, Jupyter and Dask. Access is granted to U.S. ATLAS physicists and their collaborators, including students and members of the international ATLAS Collaboration.
