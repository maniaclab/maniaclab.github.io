  label: ORIGINS
  date: Jan 01, 1961
  list:
  - A third version MANIAC III built at the Institute for Computer Research at the University of Chicago in 1964.
  - Designed by Nicholas Metropolis and constructed by the staff of the Institute for Computer Research
  - It used 20,000 diodes and 12,000 transistors, and had 16K 48-bit words of core memory.
  - Its floating multiply time was 71 microseconds, and divide was 81 microseconds.
  - Its most novel feature was unnormalized significance arithmetic floating point. This allowed users to determine the change in precision of results due to the nature of the computation.
